We’ve thought of everything in our patent-pending design to make sure this is the raddest thing you’ve ever done with your phone. Check it out:

All tops are 3-D Printed right here in the good ole USA. We’ve tested dozens of designs and sizes to make sure you get the maximum spin with the lowest profile which means no bulk when you squeeze your phone back into your skinny jeans.
